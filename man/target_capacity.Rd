\title{Target Capacity}
\usage{
target_capacity(demand, target_wait, F = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{demand}{Numeric value of rate of demand in same units as target wait - e.g. if target wait is weeks, then demand in units of patients/week.}

\item{target_wait}{Numeric value of number of weeks that has been set as the target within which the patient should be seen.}

\item{F}{Holding value, needs definition of F adding.}
}
\value{
A numeric value of target capacity required to achieve a target waiting time.
}
\description{
Calculates the target capacity to achieve a given target waiting time as a function of observed demand, target waiting time and a variability of demand parameter F.

F defaults to 1.

Target Capacity = Demand + 2 * ( 1 + 4 * F ) / Target Wait
}
\examples{

# If the target wait is 52 weeks, demand is 30 patients per week and F = 3 then
# Target capacity = 30 + 2*(1+4*3)/52 = 30.5 patients per week.

target_capacity(30,52,3)

}
