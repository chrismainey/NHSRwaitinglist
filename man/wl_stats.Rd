\title{Calculate some stats about the waiting list}
\usage{
wl_stats(waiting_list, target_wait = 4, start_date = NULL, end_date = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{waiting_list}{data.frame. A df of referral dates and removals}

\item{target_wait}{numeric. The required waiting time}

\item{start_date}{date. The start date to calculate from}

\item{end_date}{date. The end date to calculate to}
}
\value{
A data.frame of key waiting list summary statistics based on queueing
theory:

\describe{
\item{mean_demand}{Numeric. Mean number of additions to the waiting list
per week.}
\item{mean_capacity}{Numeric. Mean number of removals from the waiting list
per week.}
\item{load}{Numeric. Ratio between demand and capacity.}
\item{load_too_big}{Logical. Whether the load is greater than or equal to 1
i.e. whether the waiting list is unstable and expected to grow.}
\item{count_demand}{Numeric. Total demand (i.e. referrals) over the full
time period.}
\item{queue_size}{Numeric. Number of patients on the waiting list at the
end of the time period.}
\item{target_queue_size}{Numeric. Size of waiting list required for the
average wait time to be a quarter of the \code{target_wait}.}
\item{queue_too_big}{Logical. Whether \code{queue_size} is more than twice
the \code{target_queue_size}.}
\item{mean_wait}{Numeric. Mean waiting time in weeks.}
\item{cv_arrival}{Numeric. Coefficient of variation in time between
additions to the waiting list.}
\item{cv_removal}{Numeric. Coefficient of variation in time between
removals from the waiting list.}
\item{target_capacity}{Numeric. The weekly capacity required to maintain
the waiting list at its target equilibrium, assuming the target queue
size has been reached.}
\item{relief_capacity}{Numeric. If \code{queue_too_big} is \code{TRUE},
the weekly capacity required to reduce the queue to the target size in
26 weeks. Otherwise \code{NA}.}
\item{pressure}{Numeric. A measure of pressure on the system, defined as
\code{2 Ã— mean_wait / target_wait}.}
